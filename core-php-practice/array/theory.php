<!--
In PHP, an array is a data structure that allows you to store multiple values under a single variable name. Arrays can hold elements of any data type, including integers, strings, floats, objects, or even other arrays. They are incredibly versatile and widely used in PHP programming.

There are primarily three types of arrays in PHP:
1] Numeric Arrays
2] Associative Arrays
3] Multidimensional Arrays
