<!-- 
In PHP, identifiers refer to the names used to identify variables, functions, classes, constants, and other entities within a PHP script.

Identifiers must follow certain rules:

They can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
They must start with a letter or an underscore.
They cannot start with a number.
They are case-sensitive (e.g., $variable and $Variable are treated as different variables).
They cannot contain spaces or special characters except underscores.
They cannot be PHP reserved keywords (such as if, else, while, etc.).

Here are some examples of valid identifiers in PHP:
$variableName
$_variable
$myVariable123
$FunctionName
$ClassName

And here are some examples of invalid identifiers:
$123variable // starts with a number
$my variable // contains a space
$my-variable // contains a hyphen
