<!-- 
In PHP, keywords are reserved words that have special meaning and functionality within the language. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names or function names) in PHP code. They are integral to the syntax and structure of the language.

__halt_compiler(): Halts the compiler execution.

abstract: Used to declare abstract classes and methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, and abstract methods must be implemented by subclasses.

and: Logical operator that returns true if both operands are true.

array(): Used to create an array.

as: Used in foreach loops to iterate over arrays or objects.

break: Exits the current loop or switch statement.

callable: Used to declare a variable as callable, meaning it can hold a function or method reference.

case: Used in switch statements to define different cases.

catch: Used to handle exceptions in try-catch blocks.

class: Used to define a class.

clone: Creates a copy of an object.

const: Used to define constants within classes or globally.

continue: Skips the rest of the current loop iteration and continues with the next iteration.

declare: Used to set execution directives.

default: Used in switch statements as the default case.

die(): Alias for exit(), terminates the script execution.

do: Starts a do-while loop.

echo: Outputs one or more strings.

else: Used in if statements.

elseif: Used in if statements for additional conditions.

empty(): Checks if a variable is empty.

enddeclare: Ends the block of code started by declare.

endfor: Ends a for loop.

endforeach: Ends a foreach loop.

endif: Ends an if block.

endwhile: Ends a while loop.

enum: Introduced in PHP 8.1, used to define enumerations.

eval(): Evaluates a string as PHP code.

exit(): Terminates the script execution.

extends: Indicates inheritance in classes.

final: Prevents a class or method from being extended or overridden.

finally: Used in try-catch blocks to execute code regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught.

fn: Introduced in PHP 7.4, used to define anonymous functions.

for: Starts a for loop.

foreach: Starts a foreach loop.

function: Defines a function.

global: Allows access to a global variable within a function.

goto: Unconditional jump to another part of the code.

if: Starts an if statement.

implements: Indicates that a class implements an interface.

include: Includes and evaluates a specified file.

include_once: Includes a file only once.

instanceof: Checks if an object is an instance of a specified class.

insteadof: Used in traits to resolve conflicts in multiple trait usage.

interface: Defines an interface.

isset(): Checks if a variable is set and is not null.

list(): Assigns variables as if they were an array.

match: Introduced in PHP 8.0, a more versatile replacement for the switch statement.

namespace: Declares a namespace.

new: Creates a new instance of a class.

or: Logical operator that returns true if either operand is true.

print: Outputs a string.

private: Specifies that a class member can only be accessed within the class itself.

protected: Specifies that a class member can only be accessed within the class itself and its subclasses.

public: Specifies that a class member can be accessed from outside the class.

require: Requires and evaluates a specified file.

require_once: Requires a file only once.

return: Exits a function and optionally returns a value.

static: Specifies that a variable or method belongs to the class itself rather than an instance of the class.

switch: Starts a switch statement.

throw: Throws an exception.

trait: Defines a trait.

try: Starts a try-catch block to handle exceptions.

unset(): Unsets a variable.

use: Imports namespaces into the current namespace.

var: Declares a property in a class (obsolete in PHP 7.4 and later).

while: Starts a while loop.

xor: Logical operator that returns true if either operand is true, but not both.

yield: Used in generators to return a value.

__CLASS__: Magic constant containing the class name.

__DIR__: Magic constant containing the directory of the current file.

__FILE__: Magic constant containing the full path and filename of the current file.

__FUNCTION__: Magic constant containing the function name.

__LINE__: Magic constant containing the line number in the current file.

__METHOD__: Magic constant containing the class method name.

__NAMESPACE__: Magic constant containing the current namespace name.

__TRAIT__: Magic constant containing the trait name.
