<!-- 
In PHP, a data type is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable can hold. PHP supports several built-in data types, including:

Integer: Represents whole numbers, positive or negative, without any decimal point. Example: $x = 10;

Float (floating-point number or double): Represents numbers with decimal points or numbers in exponential form. Example: $y = 3.14;

String: Represents a sequence of characters. Example: $name = "John";

Boolean: Represents a boolean value, which can be either true or false. Example: $is_logged_in = true;

Array: Represents an ordered map that stores data values. Example: $colors = array("red", "green", "blue");

Object: Represents instances of user-defined classes. Example: $car = new Car();

Resource: Represents a special variable that holds a reference to an external resource. Example: $file = fopen("file.txt", "r");

NULL: Represents a variable with no value or uninitialized variables. Example: $x = null;

Callable: Represents a function or a method. Example: $callback = 'my_function';

Iterable: Represents an array or an object that can be iterated over. Introduced in PHP 7.1.
