<!-- 
Loops in programming are control structures that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. They are fundamental for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over data structures such as arrays. Loops enable you to perform operations multiple times without having to write the same code over and over again.

There are several types of loops commonly used in programming languages like PHP:

1] for Loop: Executes a block of code a specified number of times.

syntax:
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to be executed
}


2] while Loop: Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

syntax:
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
    // Increment or update condition inside the loop to avoid infinite loops
}


3] do...while Loop: Similar to a while loop, but it always executes the block of code at least once, even if the condition is initially false.

syntax:
do {
    // Code to be executed
    // Increment or update condition inside the loop to avoid infinite loops
} while (condition);


4] foreach Loop: Specifically designed for iterating over arrays and collections, executing a block of code for each element in the array.

syntax:
foreach ($array as $value) {
    // Code to be executed for each element in the array
}
